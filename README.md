Go programs sometime generate output you can't easily control like panics and `net/http` recovered panics. By default, those output contains multiple lines with stack traces. This does not play well with most logging systems that will generate one log event per outputed line.

The `gologpiper` is a simple program that reads those kinds of log on its standard input, and merge all lines of a given panic or standard multi-lines Go log message into a single quotted line.

## Usage

Send panics and other program panics to syslog:

    mygoprogram 2>&1 | gologpiper | logger -t mygoprogram -p local7.err

Options:

    -prefix string
    	Go logger prefix set in the application if any.
    -strip
    	Strip log line timestamps on output.
